#### The Free, Open-Source, Desktop & Hacking Simulator Game.

### This is a remaster of a very old project of mine from when I was a teen. I'm not sure how often I'll update this project but at least I'm finally working on it!

ExitCode is a desktop simulator with a emphasis on hacking. The plan is to take the best parts from my favourite games, combined with (of course) my own original ideas, and turn them into something great!

Here is a brief overview of what's to come:


* Realistic PC Desktop
* Web-universe to explore (dark web!!!)
* Play In-Game Games (Game-ception?)
* Attack, and team up with other players in multi-player, and connect with friends in the in-game social site (yet to be named)
* Find various in-game Apps/Scripts/Missions, download player-made ones, or create your own.
* Take on randomly generated jobs, attack randomly generated systems, and collect information on randomly created NPCs, in a world that expands dynamically as you play.
* Take either side of the law, be an malicious hacker, or try your luck at becoming both, with a reputation system that changes the world around you. (And how the world sees you.)
